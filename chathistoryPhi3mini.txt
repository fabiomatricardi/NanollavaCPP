assistant: 2013 NBA Finals Game in Detroit, Michigan. A young man is trying to block a shot from the top of an air ball hoop while jumping into the air with his right foot raised off the ground and his left leg extended behind him. He's wearing a black and white striped shirt that has a red stripe down its center. The image captures the intensity and focus of the moment as he tries to make contact with the basketball, which is in mid-air above him.
